# A Selection of interactive Headers

This repository consists of different interactive Headers made using **React-Three-Fiber**. They range from Physics Simulations to small animations. They also contain demos for code I was writing, to streamline the process for importing 3D Animations which are tied to the Scroll Position of the page.


## Physics Simulation

In this Physics Simulation made using **React-Three-Fiber** and **Rapier**, the User is able to swipe the individual parts of the 17K logo with his mouse and apply force to all of them when clicking.

The Simulation also contains Leva Integration for easy collaboration with other web designers, enabling a quick and easy way to test different colors and lighting effect.


## 3D Animations tied to Scroll

The two Animations called "Linien" and "Fragmente" contain tests for a system allowing for the quick implementation of 3D Animations, tied to the Scroll Position.

The two demos show how it could look and function.
